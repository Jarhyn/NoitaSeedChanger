# NoitaSeedChanger
This tool forces the game 'Noita' to use any seed you want.

Changes:

* Added seed list - you can add a seed + corresponding description to the seeds.txt by following the format SEED:DESCRIPTION - where the seed is seperated from the description by a colon.
* Added support for all Noita release branches.
* Fixed memory read/write function to use 'uint' instead of 'int' to be able to use the full range of possible seeds.
* Fixed a bug where invalid seeds caused a crash

**Compatible with the latest beta Build (Oct 16 2019)

Only supports **STEAM** releases. GoG or itch.io releases are NOT supported currently.
