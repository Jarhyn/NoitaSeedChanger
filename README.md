# NoitaSeedChanger
This tool forces the game 'Noita' to use any seed you want.


Changes:

Added seed list - you can add a seed + corresponding description to the seeds.txt by following the format SEED:DESCRIPTION - where the seed is seperated from the description by a colon.

Fixed memory write function to use 'uint' instead of 'int' to be able to use the full range of possible seeds.

Fixed other minor bugs and reorganized the project.


Compatible with the latest Build (Oct 11 2019)
