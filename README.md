# NoitaSeedChanger
This tool forces the game 'Noita' to use any seed you want.


Changes:

Added seed list - you can add a seed + corresponding description to the seeds.txt by following the format SEED:DESCRIPTION - where the seed is seperated from the description by a colon.

Added GoG version support (might be broken with a future update of Noita)

Fixed memory write function to use 'uint' instead of 'int' to be able to use the full range of possible seeds.

Fixed a bug where invalic seeds caused a crash

Compatible with the latest Build (Oct 12 2019)
